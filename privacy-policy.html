  <h1>Privacy Policy for Preloadify</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 3/30/2025</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Preloadify extension ("we", "our", or "extension") handles your data. <strong>Preloadify is designed to function entirely offline on your local device.</strong></p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p><strong>Preloadify operates completely offline.</strong> It does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, browsing history, or user data. All extension functionality occurs locally within your browser, and no data is sent to any external servers.</p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>Our extension requires the following permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>storage</strong>: To save your extension preferences (like whether the extension is enabled or disabled) locally on your device. This data remains solely on your computer.</li>
    <li><strong>host_permissions (<all_urls>)</strong>: To allow the extension's content script (which injects the preloading functionality) to run locally on all websites you visit. This permission is necessary for the extension to work but does not involve sending data externally.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The extension includes and injects the instant.page script locally into web pages. This script preloads pages when you hover over links to make navigation feel faster. While the script originates from <a href="https://instant.page" target="_blank">instant.page</a>, <strong>it is bundled with the extension and run directly from the extension files on your device. It does not communicate externally for its core preloading function and operates entirely offline.</strong> Please refer to the instant.page website for general information about the script itself.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
